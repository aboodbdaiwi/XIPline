This component implements whole lung and lobar 3He MRI ventilation measurements:

A) Whole lung 3He MRI ventilation measurements:
1. CoSeg_GPU.cu and CoSeg_kernels.cu
	GPU implementation of the 1H-3He MRI joint lung segmentation algorithm. 
2. CO_segmentation.m
	This function calls the above GPU-based segmentation function and requires: 3D 1H and 3He MR images and the respective user seeds.
3. clustering_3D.m
	This function performs k-means clustering of 3He MRI images and returns 3He MRI clustering (5 clusters) maps.
4. VDP_calculation.m
	This function requires segmented lung mask and ventilation maps, computes whole lung ventilation defect percent, and save results as a ".txt" file. 


B) Lobar 3He MRI ventilation measurements:
1. CoReg_TVL1_Newton_GPU_Ind_opt.cu and CoReg_TVL1_Newton_Ind_kernels.cu
	GPU implementation of CT-1H and CT-3He MRI simultaneous deformable registration algorithm. 
2. CoReg.m
	The function calls the above GPU registration function and requires: 3D CT, 1H and 3He MR images as inputs and returns the estimated deformation field.
3. DeformLabels3D.m
	This function deforms CT lobe mask (provided by VIDA for example) using the above obtained deformation field.
4. clustering_3D.m
	This function performs k-means clustering of 3He MRI images and returns 3He MRI clustering (5 clusters) maps.
5. VDP_calculation.m
	This function requires deformed CT lobe mask and 3He MRI cluster maps, computes lobar lung ventilation defect percent, and save results as a ".txt" file.
