# Installation
Open setup.m in matlab and execute the script. This will add the spectroscopy code to your matlab path, but only for the current matlab instance (ie by default you will need to repeat running the setup.m script each time you open MATLAB). To save the path, just type 'savepath' in the MATLAB command window. 

# Example code and usage
Start by working through demo_NRM_Mix.m, which is an example of many of the functionalities of this code (zeropadding, linebroadening, fitting options, display, etc).
